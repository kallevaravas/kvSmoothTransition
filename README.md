kvSmoothTransition
==================

kvSmoothTransition plugin is a simple fix for people, who want have smooth hover transitions for their designs and layouts. This plugin works for most possible element types and all possible css types. Very easy to setup and uses only 3 options.

This project originally started from the need to smoothly switch between normal and hovered element. After endless of research, [SO question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6800950/smooth-transition-between-two-class-and-classhover) was started. It did get some results, but the codes were very minimal or oversized -- nothing dry or neat.

This code is sadly from 2011, and now there are more browser support for these types of things. But hopefully someone can benefit from this script yet.
